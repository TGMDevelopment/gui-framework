# gui-framework
An attempt to make a ui framework in Java, with the intent to be used with minecraft

https://github.com/memononen/nanovg
I've chosen to use nanovg for this project, as it allows me to draw stuff easily and has lwjgl support ect
I'm not using nanovg widgets or anything
I just want an easy library to draw shit
